// MessageClasses contains type of assist message we expect users to send.

// categories. If this succeeds, we send an event into the analytics pipeline.
//
// Keys are the category names, those are the ones reported in the event and
// generated by the model. Values are the category description. They are used to
// build the model prompt and allow to provide more context to the model to
// improve the classification.
