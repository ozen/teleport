title: Setting up self-hosted automatic agent updates 
description: How to setup automatic agent update for self-hosted Teleport
---

Teleport supports automatic agent updates for
systemd-based Linux distributions using `apt`, `yum`, and `zypper` package managers,
and Kubernetes clusters. The [automatic updates architecture 
page](../../architecture/agent-update-management.mdx) describes how agent
updating works.

This guide covers how to set up the automatic update infrastructure. If this is
already done, or you are a Teleport Cloud user, you can directly
[enroll agents into automatic updates](./enroll-agent-into-automatic-updates.mdx).

<Admonition type="warning">
Systemd agents enrolled into automatic updates can only install versions
present in their package repositories. As Teleport 14 won't be published to
`stable/v13`, those agents will require manual intervention to be updated to
the next major version (adding a new APT/YUM/zypper repo for `stable/v14`).
Alternatively, you can use the `stable/rolling` channel, which contains
Teleport v13.3.2 forward, including future major releases.

## Requirements

- Self-hosted Teleport cluster v13.0 or higher.
- `tctl` execution on the auth machine or a role allowing verbs `create`, `read`,
  `update`, `delete` on the resource `cluster_maintenance_config`.
- Either:
  - a public S3/GCS bucket,
  - a web server accessible from all agents with valid TLS certificates.

## Step 1/3. Create release channel files

A release channel contains two pieces of information: the targeted version
and if the update is critical. Updaters subscribe to a release channel and will
update to the provided version during a maintenance window if possible. If the
update is critical, updaters will ignore the maintenance schedule and update as
soon as possible.

Create a directory for the new release channel `current`.

```code
$ mkdir current/
```

Make the `current` release channel target the version (=teleport.version=):

```code
$ echo -n "(=teleport.version=)" > current/version
```

And mark the update as not critical:

```code
$ echo -n "no" > current/critical
```

## Step 2/3. Host the release channel files on the version server

The release channel must be hosted on a webserver with trusted TLS certificates
and reachable by all agents.

Public cloud buckets like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage are good
candidates as they provide reliable low-maintenance file hosting.

You can also serve the files with a regular webserver like `nginx`.
The release channel needs to be served over HTTPS.

Choose a way to serve the release channel and setup the hosting.

The webserver must answer the following queries:

```code
$ curl https://<hosting-domain-and-path>/current/version
(=teleport.version=)

$ curl https://<hosting-domain-and-path>/current/critical
no
```

The web server serving the release channel is called the version server.
Save the version server domain and release channel name (here respectively
`<hosting-domain-and-path>` and `current`) as they will be required
later to configure the agent updaters.

## Step 3/3. Configure the maintenance schedule

At this point the updaters can be configured to pull the version from the
release channel and update the agents. However, they still don't know when
they should perform updates.

Agents can retrieve the maintenance schedule from the Teleport cluster and
pass it to the updater. In this step you'll configure the maintenance
schedule for the whole cluster.

Create the following `cmc.yaml` manifest allowing maintenances on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday between 02:00 and 03:00 UTC.

(!docs/pages/includes/cluster-maintenance-config-spec.mdx!)

Finally, apply the manifest using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create cmc.yaml
maintenance window has been updated
```

## Next steps

At this point, the cluster is ready for agent automatic updates.
Agents configured to automatically update will fetch their version from the
version server. By changing the target version served by the version server
you can upgrade or downgrade the agents.

You can now [enroll agents into automatic updates](./enroll-agent-into-automatic-updates.mdx).
