## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster v13.1 or above with a configured [self-hosted
  PostgreSQL](../guides/postgres-self-hosted.mdx) or [RDS
  PostgreSQL](../guides/rds.mdx) database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/configure-admin.mdx!)

Teleport will use the same authentication mechanism when connecting as an admin
user as for regular user connections: X.509 for self-hosted databases and AWS
IAM for RDS. The admin user must have privileges within the database to create
users and grant them privileges.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="RDS PostgreSQL">
The RDS PostgreSQL admin user must have the `rds_iam` role attached to allow IAM
authentication:

```sql
CREATE USER "teleport-admin" login createrole;
GRANT rds_iam TO "teleport-admin";
```

Note that the RDS database must have IAM authentication enabled.

Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html) to make sure you are using the `rds_iam` role correctly.
for more information.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Self-hosted PostgreSQL">
The self-hosted PostgreSQL admin user must have X.509 authentication configured.

```sql
CREATE USER "teleport-admin" login createrole;
```

Note that the database must be configured to accept client certificate auth
for the admin user by having the following entries in `pg_hba.conf`:

```conf
hostssl all             all             ::/0                    cert
hostssl all             all             0.0.0.0/0               cert
```

Refer to the [self-hosted PostgreSQL guide](../guides/postgres-self-hosted.mdx#step-35-configure-your-postgresql-server)
to ensure that your configuration is correct.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Users created by Teleport will be placed in the `teleport-auto-user` group in
the database, which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

## Step 2/3. Configure a Teleport role

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/common-teleport-role.mdx!)

Users created within the database will:

- Have the same username as the authenticated Teleport user.
- Be a part of the `teleport-auto-user` role.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database. See PostgreSQL
  [CREATE ROLE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html)
  for information on how to create database roles.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/connect.mdx gui="pgAdmin"!)

## Troubleshooting

### Permission denied for schema public error

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/postgres15-grant-create.mdx!)

## Next steps

- Connect using your [GUI database
  client](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx).
- Learn about [role
  templating](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx#interpolation-rules).
- Read automatic user provisioning
  [RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0113-automatic-database-users.md).
- The `internal.db_roles` traits we illustrated in this guide
  are replaced with values from the Teleport local user database. For full
  details on how variable expansion works in Teleport roles, see the [Teleport
  Access Controls Reference](../../access-controls/reference.mdx).
