{{ client="The plugin" }}

Like all Teleport users, `{{ user }}` needs signed credentials in order to
connect to your Teleport cluster. You will use the `tctl auth sign` command to
request these credentials.

The following `tctl auth sign` command impersonates the `{{ user }}` user,
generates signed credentials, and writes an identity file to the local
directory:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user={{ user }} --out=auth.pem
```

{{ client }} connects to the Teleport Auth Service's gRPC endpoint over TLS.

The identity file, `auth.pem`, includes both TLS and SSH credentials. {{ client }}
uses the SSH credentials to connect to the Proxy Service, which establishes a
reverse tunnel connection to the Auth Service. {{ client }}  uses this reverse
tunnel, along with your TLS credentials, to connect to the Auth Service's gRPC
endpoint.

>

  By default, `tctl auth sign` produces certificates with a relatively short
  lifetime. For production deployments, we suggest using [Machine
  ID](../../machine-id/introduction.mdx) to programmatically issue and renew
  certificates for your plugin. See our Machine ID [getting started
  guide](../../machine-id/getting-started.mdx) to learn more.

  Note that you cannot issue certificates that are valid longer than your existing credentials.
  For example, to issue certificates with a 1000-hour TTL, you must be logged in with a session that is
  valid for at least 1000 hours. This means your user must have a role allowing
  a `max_session_ttl` of at least 1000 hours (60000 minutes), and you must specify a `--ttl`
  when logging in:

  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --ttl=60060
  ```
