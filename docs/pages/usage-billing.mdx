title: Usage Reporting and Billing
description: Provides a detailed breakdown of Teleport usage reporting and billing.
---

Commercial editions of Teleport send anonymized usage data to Teleport so we can
calculate billing metrics. This guide describes the anonymized usage data and
the billing metrics we calculate.

## Anonymized usage data

The commercial editions of Teleport send anonymized information to Teleport's
cloud infrastructure. This information contains the following:

- Teleport license identifier.
- Anonymized cluster name and Teleport Auth Service host ID.
- For each Teleport user, the anonymized user name and a count of interactions
  with infrastructure resources enrolled in your Teleport cluster. 

Self-hosted Teleport deployments aggregate interaction data before it reaches
Teleport Cloud. Teleport Cloud accounts provide this information as an
anonymized log, which Teleport aggregates over the billing period.  

The count of interactions includes the following:

- Teleport logins
- SSH and Kubernetes exec sessions
- Web sessions with registered HTTP applications
- Connections with registered TCP applications
- SSH port forwards
- Kubernetes API requests
- SFTP actions

The anonymization is done by passing names and IDs through HMAC-SHA-256, with an
HMAC key that's randomly generated when the Teleport cluster is initialized and
is never shared with us. This makes it infeasible for anyone without access to
the cluster to deanonymize the data we store.

The code that aggregates and anonymizes this data can be found in our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/lib/usagereporter/teleport/aggregating).

## Billing metrics

Teleport uses the anonymized usage data described in the previous section to
calculate three types of billing metrics:

- Monthly Active Users
- Teleport Protected Resources
- Teleport Identity Authorizations

### Monthly Active Users 

Monthly Active Users (MAU) are calculated as the aggregate number of unique
active users (as defined in the Services Agreement and aggregated over each
monthly period starting on the Subscription Start Date and ending on each
monthly anniversary thereafter) accessing Teleport. 

"Active" means a user having performed any auditable activity in a resource
(e.g., an action that would appear in an audit log such as logging into a
resource via the Web UI or via `tsh login`, submitting an Access Request, etc.).
The MAU calculation does not include automated actions, such as the modification
of a user's role by an administrator or the automatic creation of a user
automatically through an identity provider.

### Teleport Protected Resources

The Teleport Protected Resources (TPR) metric is calculated as the aggregate
number of unique resources (aggregated over each monthly period starting on the
Subscription Start Date and ending on each monthly anniversary thereafter)
connected to Teleport. A "resource" means any unique endpoint such as a
Kubernetes cluster, SSH server, database instance or serverless endpoint, that
is registered itself with the Teleport cluster and is protected by Teleport.

### Teleport Identity Authorizations

Teleport Identity Authorizations (TIA) are calculated as the aggregate number of
Authorization Requests (aggregated over each monthly period starting on the
Subscription Start Date and ending on each monthly anniversary thereafter)
processed by Teleport. An Authorization Request is the authorization by Teleport
of a client connection, API request, SSH session, or any other activity related
to a user.

## Usage measurement for billing

The counts of the billing metrics are aggregated on a monthly basis starting on
the Subscription Start Date and ending on each monthly anniversary thereafter.
The amount of usage purchased by a Teleport customer is based on the maximum
aggregate amount of a billing metric in a given month during the term of the
Subscription (also known as a high water mark calculation).
