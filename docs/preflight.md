## Preflight Checklist

This checklist is to be run prior to cutting the release branch.

- [ ] Bump Web UI dependencies
- [ ] Make a new docs/VERSION folder
- [ ] Update VERSION in Makefile to next dev tag
- [ ] Update TELEPORT_VERSION in assets/aws/Makefile
- [ ] Update `base-ref` to point to the new release branch in `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yaml`
- [ ] Update mentions of the version in examples/ and README.md
- [ ] Search code for DELETE IN and REMOVE IN comments and clean up if appropriate
- [ ] Update docs/faq.mdx "Which version of Teleport is supported?" section with release date and support info
- [ ] Update the CI buildbox image
  - [ ] Update the `BUILDBOX_VERSION` in `build.assets/images.mk`
  - [ ] Run `make dronegen` and ensure _all_ buildbox references in the resulting yaml refer to the new image
  - [ ] Commit and merge. Drone should build new buildbox images and push to
    `public.ecr.aws`
- [ ] Update the list of OCI images to rebuild nightly in
  [`rebuild-teleport-oci-distroless-cron.yml` on `master`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.e/blob/master/.github/workflows/rebuild-teleport-oci-distroless-cron.yml)
